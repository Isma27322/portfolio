# My Eagle project

## About my eagle project
For my eagle project I decided to make 6 videos on info about trains at the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin
Designed to be informative of the person watching it, and not being too long

## The "Why"
The reason why I chose this as my eagle project over other options are:
I am really interested in trains myself and I wanted to share that interest with the general public
It sounded the most interesting to me over the other options

## About the videos
The videos are all informative videos about some of the trains at the National Railroad Museum
to allow people who don't want to read the text about it
The videos are somewhat interactive where we allow the people to follow along with the videos in the actual trains
The videos are not too long to not lose interest of some people
The videos show parts of the trains that some people might not notice/ be able to see
The videos talk about the history of the trains that people might not know about the trains

## The videos:
You don't have to watch them but these are all the videos
