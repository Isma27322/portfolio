# My Projects

Here are a few of the things I've built to put my skills into practice.

### Learning Python <img src="./_static/python-logo-452175197.png" alt="drawing" style="width:50px;"/>

* **The Challenge:** Learning Python because It sounded like a fun challenge and I heard before that it had a lot of external libraries that work with Python.
* **My Approach:** Unlike some people, I was learning Python from scrach with no knknowledge, just knowing other programing lanuages like it: C++
* **Tech I Used:** Python
* **The Outcome:** The outcome was a big lightbulb of ideas that I could now do. I just couldin't wait to start exploring. I would have to say I will never have a final outcome with Python because I have only scratched the surfice of what I can do with it.

### Building a discord bot

* **The Challenge:** The challenge was that I had to build a discord bot with Python using the discord.py library without useing any external tools to host the bot
* **My Approach:** When I first started using discord.py I had to spend a lot of time looking it the documentation to figure out how it worked and what did what. I also did a lot of experimenting to see what did and didn't work, and just seeing how I can accomplish what I wanted to do at the time with that bot.
* **The cool things I learned:** I have to say the coolest thing I learned was just how to work with an external library in Python. This was one of my first times doing that, it was also when I learned how to read and write from files, even while the program was activily running.
* **Tech I Used:** I mostly used Python
* **The Outcome:** The final result is still growing as I am always thinking of ideas for building a discord bot

### Building my home lab
* **The Challenge:** The main challenge for me is that I wanted to get away from the cloud a little and make my own home lab
* **My Approach:** The main roadblock is that at the time I didin't know much about Linux and the Linux command line and I found it scary, but I just started exploring it and discovered how much I like it now over a GUI(Graphical User Interface).
* **Tech I Used:** A Linux server, bash, Python, docker, etc.
* **The Outcome:** I think the biggist take away I had from this is just how much I learned about Linux and the Linux command line and how easy it really is to learn.
* **Check it out:** [Take a tour of my home lab](./home-lab/index.md)
