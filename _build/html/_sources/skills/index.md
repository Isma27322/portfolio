### Core Strengths

* **Problem Solving:** I love the challenge of digging into an issue until I find the root cause.
* **Communication:** I'm good at explaining technical stuff in a way that makes sense, without a lot of jargon.
* **Hands-on Learner:** I learn best by doing. If I don't know something, I'll build a project around it to figure it out.
