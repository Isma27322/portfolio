# My Projects

Here are a few of the things I've built to put my skills into practice.

---
### Learning Python
* **The Challenge:** Learning python because It sounded like a fun challenge and I heard before that it had a lot of external libraries that work with python.
* **My Approach:** Unlike some people, I was learning python from scrach with no knknowledge, just knowing other programing lanuages like it: C++
* **Tech I Used:** Python
* **The Outcome:** The outcome was a big lightbulb of ideas that I could now do. I just couldin't wait to start exploring. I would have to say I will never have a final outcome with python because I have only scratched the surfice of what I can do with it.

### Building a discord bot
* **The Challenge:** The challenge was that I had to build a discord bot with python using the discord.py library without useing any external tools to host the bot
* **My Approach:** When I first started using discord.py I had to spend a lot of time looking at the documitation to figure out how it worked and what did what, I also did a lot of expermenting to see what did and didin't work, and just seeing how I can accomplish what I wanted to do at the time with that bot
* **The cool things I learned:** I have to say the coolest thing I learned was just how to work with an external library in python, this was one of my first times doing that, it was also when I learned how to read and write from files even while the program was activily running
* **Tech I Used:** I mostly used python
* **The Outcome:** The final result is still growing as I am always thinking of ideas for building a discord bot

### Building my home lab
* **The Challenge:** The main challenge for me is that I wanted to get away from the cloud a little and make my own home lab
* **My Approach:** The main rodeblock is that at the time I didin't know much about linux and the linux command line and I found it scarry, but I just started exploring it and discovered how much I like it now over a gui(Graphical User Interface).
* **Tech I Used:** A linux server, bash, python, docker, etc.
* **The Outcome:** I think the biggist take away I had from this is just how much I learned about linux and the linux command line and how easy it really is to learn.
* **Check it out:** [Take a tour of my home lab](./home-lab/intro.md)
