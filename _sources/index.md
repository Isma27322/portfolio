### Tech enthusiast who loves figuring things out and helping people.  

<br/>

---

I'm a recent college graduate who's excited to dive into the IT world. I'm passionate about technology, not just as a job, but as a puzzle to be solved. I get a huge kick out of learning how things work and then using that knowledge to make tech less frustrating for others. I'm looking for a spot on a helpdesk team where I can put my skills to the test and keep learning every day.
