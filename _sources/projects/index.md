# My Projects

Here are a few of the things I've built to put my skills into practice.

### Learning Python <img src="../_static/python-logo.png" alt="Python logo" style="width:50px; background-color: transparent;"/>

* **The Challenge:** I learned python because it sounded like a fun challenge and I heard that it had a lot of external libraries that work with it. 
* **My Approach:** Unlike some people, I was learning Python from scratch with no knowledge, just knowing other programming languages like it: C++.
* **Tech I Used:** Python
* **The Outcome:** The outcome was a big lightbulb of ideas that I could now execute. I couldn't wait to start exploring. I will never have a final outcome with Python because I have only scratched the surface of what I can do with it.

### Building a Discord Bot

* **The Challenge:** The challenge was to build a Discord Bot with Python using the discord\.py library, without using any external tools to host the bot.
* **My Approach:** When I first started using discord\.py I had to spend a lot of time looking at the documentation to figure out how it worked and what did what. I also did a lot of experimenting to see what did and didn't work, and seeing how I can accomplish what I wanted to do at the time with that bot.
* **The cool things I learned:** I have to say the coolest thing I learned was how to work with an external library in Python. This was one of my first times doing that; it was also when I learned how to read and write from files, even while the program was activily running.
* **Tech I Used:** I mostly used Python.
* **The Outcome:** The final result is still growing as I am always thinking of ideas for building a Discord Bot.

### Building my Home Lab
* **The Challenge:** The main challenge for me was that I wanted to get away from the cloud a little and make my own home lab
* **My Approach:** The main roadblock is that at the time I didn't know much about Linux and the Linux command line and I found it scary, but I started exploring it and discovered how much I like it now over a GUI(Graphical User Interface).
* **Tech I Used:** A Linux server, BASH, Python, Docker, etc.
* **The Outcome:** I think the biggest take away I had from this is just how much I learned about Linux and the Linux command line and how easy it really is to learn.
* **Check it out:** [Take a tour of my home lab](../home-lab/index.md)

### Learning Fabric

* **What is Fabric?** Fabric is an open-source framework that uses AI to augment human capabilities by providing a modular system for creating, sharing, and managing AI prompts to solve specific, real-world problems.
* **The Challenge:** The main challenge for me was it is a new tool that I never used before
* **My Approach:** My approach was mainly just to experiment with it see what it did.
* **Tech I Used:** Fabric
* **Why I use it:** I use it because fabric is a really powerful tool that is fully customizable, I also use it because it is able to help me with my day to day life.
* **The Outcome:** I think the outcome is always growing, fabric is a very powerful tool that you can make work exactly the way you want.
