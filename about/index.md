### My Approach to Tech
What really gets me excited about technology is figuring out how it all fits together, and then using that knowledge to help someone out. I've always learned best by just jumping in and doing it, which is how I ended up setting up my own home servers and learning Python from scratch. There's nothing better than cracking a tough technical problem, especially when you can see it's made a real difference for someone.

I'm always looking for the next challenge and I'm never afraid to ask questions or take feedback to get better.
